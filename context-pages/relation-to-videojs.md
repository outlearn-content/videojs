Excited about ES6? Ready to take a look at those parts that we use in VideoJS? Inside the following modules there are both small and larger tasks. The idea is that you can get your hands dirty and really apply what you learn. Do try them out and if you get stuck, Stack Overflow is a great way to get help. Please follow our [suggestions for asking questions on Stack Overflow](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/wiki/Support) to increase the likelihood of a helpful answer.

We hope you will have fun!

Matt, Steve
