So how are you feeling? Ready to try your newly acquired Riak chops in a test environment that closely mirrors our production setup? You'll have some real data and can see some of the code we use to make Riak sing at Chartbeat. I hope you'll have fun playing around with things. You should also convincing yourself that you really understood what you were learning.

Go right ahead and try if you can break something and then see how to fix it :).
