We do most of our Riak work in Python and bulk of this path is devoted to getting your ready for that. You’ll learn about Riak CRUD operations, querying, and object modeling, all in Python. We will also show you how we do object modeling here at Charbeat.

In the Python modules more than in any of the others, it’ll be super helpful for you to make sure you understand what you read and complete the tasks included in the modules. This will include some tasks where you will send in a deliverable such as a piece of code that you wrote. The idea is to help you get your hands dirty and put things to practice right away. That way you’ll learn quicker and remember what you learned more easily.

Like I said earlier, go ahead and work together on anything you get stuck one. Learning together is great warmup for coding together.
