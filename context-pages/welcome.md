# Welcome

Hi folks.  Welcome to our path "Get Going with ES6 in VideoJS"

We released VideoJS version 5.0 on DATE and we're super excited to highlight what's new. One of the big changes is the inclusion of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) features in the library. This path will give you a quick overview the ES6 features that matter most to VideoJS 5.0 and let you put them to practice.

We will start the learning path with a selection from Luke Hoban's excellent [es6features](http://git.io/es6features) repo. If you want to show your support, go give it a star on GitHub. You'll learn what ES6 has to say about modules, let and const, and destructuring. The second module contains a snapshot of the evolving documentation for ES6 classes that is being constructed at Mozilla Developer Network. Following that, we added a link to the ES6 REPL by the good folks at Babel. You can use this to test out your new ES6 skills. Finally, we included the full content of Luke Hoban's ES6 Features as a reference for those of you that are interested.

Most of the modules have both small and larger tasks for you inside them. The idea is that you can get your hands dirty and really apply what you learn. Do try them out and if you get stuck, Stack Overflow is a great way to get help. Please follow our [suggestions for asking questions on Stack Overflow](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/wiki/Support) to increase the likelihood of a helpful answer.

The final module in the path lets you try out your new learning in the context of VideoJS. We hope that you will enjoy it!

This path is a pilot both for us and Outlearn. We would love to hear any feedback and so would they. There's a widget in the platform for comments, bug reports, etc. Don't be shy to use it. And since the [content of this path is stored on Github](https://github.com/outlearn-content/videojs), if you want to improve something directly, go ahead and submit a pull request!


# Here is what you be able to do

The focus of this path is on giving you new skills that you can put to practice. After completing all the learning in the path, you will be able to:

- Understand JavaScript code that includes ES6 features
- Use modules
- Use the `let` + `const` construct
- Use destructuring
- Use classes


# Expectations for time commitment

Part of the beauty of online learning is that you can time it flexibly. But you do need to put in serious effort to get most out of this path. Everyone learns differently and some people like to skim things quickly and come back later while others dig deep at first go. We think that you'll need an average of X hours to get through this path, including completing the tasks included in the modules.

# Prerequisites

This path assumes that you already know JavaScript and VideoJS. The focus is on helping you get familiar with the new features in VideoJS 5.0.

Good luck!

Matt, Steve
