Hi folks.  Welcome to our path "Get Going with ES6 in VideoJS"

We released VideoJS version 5.0 on DATE and we're super excited to highlight what's new. One of the big changes is the inclusion of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) features in the library. This path will give you a quick overview of ES6 and then dive into the parts that matter most to VideoJS 5.0.

The first part of the path is made up of several openly licensed modules about ES6. The last module gives you a chance to show off your new VideoJS skills. Inside most of the modules there are both small and larger tasks. The idea is that you can get your hands dirty and really apply what you learn. Do try them out and when you get stuck, you can ask for help on the ask one of the other people going through the path. If you can't figure it out together, Stack Overflow is a great way to get help. Please follow our [suggestions for asking questions on Stack Overflow](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/wiki/Support).

This path is a pilot both for us and Outlearn. We would love to hear any feedback and so would they. There's a widget in the platform for comments, bug reports, etc. Don't be shy to use it. And since the [content is all on Github](https://github.com/outlearn-content/videojs), if you want to improve something directly, go ahead and submit a pull request!


# Here is what you be able to do

The focus of this path is on giving you new skills that you can put to practice. After completing all the learning in the path, you will be able to:

- Understand code including ES6 features
- Use modules
- Use the `let` + `const` construct
- Use destructuring
- Use classes


# Expectations for time commitment

Part of the beauty of online learning is that you can time it flexibly. But you do need to put in serious effort to get most out of this path. Everyone learns differently and some people like to skim things quickly and come back later while others dig deep at first go. We think that you'll need an average of X hours to get through this path, including completing the tasks included in the modules.

# Prerequisites

This path assumes that you already know JavaScript and VideoJS. The focus is on helping you get familiar with the new features in VideoJS 5.0.

Good luck!

Matt, Steve
