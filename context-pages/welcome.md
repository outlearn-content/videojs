Hi folks.  Welcome to our path "Get Going with ES6 in VideoJS"

We released VideoJS version 5.0 on DATE and we're super excited to highlight what's new. One of the big changes is the inclusion of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) features in the library. This path will give you a quick overview of ES6 and then dive into the parts that matter most to VideoJS 5.0.

We will start the learning path with a selection of pre-existing resources about ES6 organized to make them as convenient as possible for you. The first module reproduces Luke Hoban's excellent [es6features](http://git.io/es6features) repo. If you want to show your support, go give it a star on GitHub. You don't need to study all of the new ES6 features in detail, this module is included to give you an overview and a reference. The second module links to the ES6 REPL by the good folks at Babel. You can use this to test out your new ES6 skills.

After a general overview of ES6, we'll jump into those aspects of the new standard that matter directy to VideoJS. One module is just a selection of the relevant parts of Luke Hoban's repo we mentioned earlier. It talks about modules, let and const, and destructuring. The module after that contains a snapshot of the evolving documentation for ES6 classes that is being constructed at Mozilla Developer Network. The last module gives you a chance to show off your new VideoJS skills.

This path is a pilot both for us and Outlearn. We would love to hear any feedback and so would they. There's a widget in the platform for comments, bug reports, etc. Don't be shy to use it. And since the [content of this path is stored on Github](https://github.com/outlearn-content/videojs), if you want to improve something directly, go ahead and submit a pull request!


# Here is what you be able to do

The focus of this path is on giving you new skills that you can put to practice. After completing all the learning in the path, you will be able to:

- Understand JavaScript code that includes ES6 features
- Use modules
- Use the `let` + `const` construct
- Use destructuring
- Use classes


# Expectations for time commitment

Part of the beauty of online learning is that you can time it flexibly. But you do need to put in serious effort to get most out of this path. Everyone learns differently and some people like to skim things quickly and come back later while others dig deep at first go. We think that you'll need an average of X hours to get through this path, including completing the tasks included in the modules.

# Prerequisites

This path assumes that you already know JavaScript and VideoJS. The focus is on helping you get familiar with the new features in VideoJS 5.0.

Good luck!

Matt, Steve
